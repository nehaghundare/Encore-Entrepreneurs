Additionally, businesses are increasingly incorporating ergonomic solutions as part of their corporate wellness programs, which further boosts the adoption of adjustable height desks in the office sector. <p>The demand for adjustable height desks in office settings is also spurred by the shift towards remote and hybrid work models. As more employees work from home, companies are providing them with ergonomic office furniture to ensure they can maintain a comfortable and healthy working environment.
